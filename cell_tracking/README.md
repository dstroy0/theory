# The workbook is the ledger

**Purpose:** One place where every idea the engine rests on is written down beside what stands behind it; a later session knows at a glance which claims are proved, which are measured, which are built but unmeasured, and which are still only theory.
**Scope:** `theory/`. The thought experiments are in `thought_experiments/`: most can be tested and some cannot yet, and each is kept as it was written, with only Gemini's export artifacts removed (the `[cite: …]` markers, which pointed at nothing, and a medical disclaimer Gemini attached after misreading exact limb arithmetic).

## How an entry is kept

Every claim carries one status, and the status says what backs it:

| status | what it means |
|---|---|
| **proved** | an exact check ran over the whole set and found no exception; the count is given |
| **measured** | a number was taken on named samples; the number is given, and whether it held up |
| **built** | the code exists and runs; no measurement yet says whether it helps |
| **theory** | stated, not built |
| **refuted** | measured, and the measurement went against it; kept, with the number; it is not tried again blind |
| **not so** | fails on its own arithmetic or in any machine, before anything is measured; kept, with the reason |

A claim changes status only when a run changes it, and the run is named. Nothing is deleted from the ledger. An idea that failed stays, with the number that failed it.

## Entries

| file | what it holds |
|---|---|
| [keys_explained.md](keys_explained.md) | the ideas a programmer's defaults push against, from first principles with the engine's numbers: transitivity carried all the way, the imprint, AND and add, unbounded operations in a small key, folding a check into a pass, exact arithmetic with no floor, the noise read and never modeled |
| [imprint_key_cycle.md](imprint_key_cycle.md) | the atom; imprinting a program onto the impulse; keys as AND masks; running a key over the set in one cycle |
| [noise_sieve_tower.md](noise_sieve_tower.md) | the transfinite noise sieve and the fluidic architecture, section by section against the engine: control and data planes, the key and LUT, the tower and floor −4, the demon's eyes and arms, the construct kit, identity as coherence, entropy |
| [engine_table.md](engine_table.md) | the machine part by part, held to no scale: its exact algebra, what each part does and wants, every hypothesis tried with its result, and the audit of every number that still fixes a scale |
| [vertical_time_compression.md](vertical_time_compression.md) | the record machine's stacked floors: what a stack is, what it compresses and leaves as it is, what bounds its file and its record, the heap and the ring across the floors of the two towers, the crystal as a code length and the lens, and what is proved, measured and derived about each |
| [two_crystals.md](two_crystals.md) | the record machine over the 2-adic integers: the wrap as a projection, the five operations that commute with every projection and the test that proves it, the exact quotient by an odd divisor as a 2-adic product, the bits the lifting reads, the two limits of the finite windows and the solenoid between them, what passes to a limit, the crystal as a boundary measured on itself, the top projection and its limit ℝ, the odd crystals and the places of ℚ, the count each crystal keeps, and Doug's posits bounded |
| [kolmogorov_arnold.md](kolmogorov_arnold.md) | the Kolmogorov–Arnold representation theorem held exactly: where the engine already has its shape (the tower's lifting, the residual, the binomial ladder as integer B-splines, the cycle's sums), why that is not a KAN (a KAN fits float splines and rounds; the engine fits nothing and rounds nothing), and what finishes it |
| [compression_table.md](compression_table.md) | the crystal's size set by set against the floor the data allows: the ladder of exact bounds from raw to the noise floor, every coder variant tried, and the order to close the gap |
| [tessera_scheduler.md](tessera_scheduler.md) | the scheduler: how jobs from separate processes share one device by memory, the accounting and its invariant, measuring by pid on Linux and Windows, one daemon per host |
| [obsignatio_seal.md](obsignatio_seal.md) | the seal: the dimensional Merkle DAG of keyed BLAKE3 nodes over every crystal and set, what it proves, what it costs, and where it stops |
| [cell_tracking_table.md](cell_tracking_table.md) | the cell program's n-body problem part by part: the physics, what the program does for each part, what it wants, every hypothesis tried with its result, and the tracker's equation as reads of the machine |
| [ledger.md](ledger.md) | every measurement, dated, in the order it was taken, with its samples and its result |

## Thought experiments

| file | origin |
|---|---|
| `thought_experiments/noise_sieve_1_rule_propagation.md` | the first draft: top-down rule propagation down the tower to floor −4 |
| `thought_experiments/noise_sieve_2_lut_beamformer_collapse.md` | adds the binary LUT engine, two's complement exact division, the beamformer and the 2D collapse |
| `thought_experiments/noise_sieve_3_tower_scheduling_floor_minus_4.md` | adds temporal stacking, the master schedule and floor −4 as the irreducible limit |
| `thought_experiments/noise_sieve_4_laplace_demon.md` | adds the demon: shift agreement as its eyes, the identity:null permutation as its arms |
| `thought_experiments/noise_sieve_5_cell_tracking_harmonics.pdf` | the sieve applied to this competition: the engine holds nothing and gradients define themselves; a split as a boundary discontinuity; mitosis and lysis judged over the whole sample by an entropy bump; each body's spherical harmonic fingerprint, dipole and quadrupole dominant |
| `thought_experiments/fluidic_1_demon_uroboros_construct_kit.md` | the fluidic tower: the demon observer, the self-feeding loop, the three irreducible sets |
| `thought_experiments/fluidic_2_elevator_identity_entropy.md` | the elevator operator, recursive inflation, identity as the limit of coherence, binary probes, entropy |
| `thought_experiments/subtractive_cosmological_framework.pdf` | a conversation, eight pages: rules propagating at field speed, not instantly; arrival as a wavefront; listening at the noise floor; phase cancellation; the identity:null permutation as field noise readings only |
| `thought_experiments/cyclic_field_inversion_seed_crystal.pdf` | exported as "Solving N-Body Problems Deterministically", though it holds no n-body method: a conversation, four pages, on the field inverting at maximum entropy, the seed crystal, and the needle snap just off zero radius that breaks symmetry and sets the next field's propagation speed |
| `thought_experiments/hash_boundary_functional_folding.md` | the boundary functional of a 2^120 hash keyspace as a threshold latch, and folding schemes that keep an accumulator one size however much is folded |
| `thought_experiments/demon_utm_four_noise_vectors.md` | the demon and a non-halting UTM treating video noise as deterministic: the residual tensor F − I split into four vector magnitudes (shot, thermal/read, fixed pattern, quantization) integrated over n frames |
| `thought_experiments/utm_demon_openqasm.md` | a UTM paired with Laplace's demon running an OpenQASM circuit: the 2^n state vector, unitaries, and measurement without dice |
