# ====================================================================
# THE LOCALE STAGE. BRITISH CONVENTION AGAINST AMERICAN, AS A PATTERN AND NOT AS A LIST
# ====================================================================
#
# code-documentation:149 states this rule in one sentence and states it as a shape: "Never a British
# variant, and the ban is on the pattern rather than on a list: no `-ise` or `-isation` where
# American takes `-ize` or `-ization`, no `-our` for `-or`, no `-re` for `-er`, no doubled `l` in
# `modelled`, `labelled`, `signalled`." code-comments:157 says the same thing shorter.
#
# This tuple was ten literals until now, and the sentence says not to write ten literals.
# Measured against idemIP at 242ec74, which is pushed and reachable from origin/main: 22 distinct
# British word forms are present in that tree and the ten literals reached 7 of them. The 5-hit
# `analys*` class, the 9-hit `cancell*` class, `defence`, `distil`, `initialis*`, `licence`,
# `normalisation`, `optimis*`, `parenthesised`, `recognised` and `signalled` were all invisible.
# The arms below reach 22 of 22 at that ref. Re-derive both numbers before quoting either one:
# maint/prose/test_docs_check_coverage.py does it from the tree at run time.
#
# LOCALE WAS NOT A SCAN, AND THAT IS THE STRUCTURAL HALF OF THE SAME FAULT. It was referenced at
# exactly one site, stage_of(), where it only decided a word in the report. The ten British patterns
# were enforced because BANNED held a second copy of them, written out by hand. Adding a pattern
# here changed the label on a finding and never produced one. BANNED now splices this tuple in
# directly. The two cannot drift and there is one place to edit.
#
# THE TEN ORIGINALS ARE CARRIED FORWARD CHARACTER FOR CHARACTER, in their original order, ahead of
# everything new. HUMAN_RATE is keyed by pattern string and holds a measured rate for eight of them,
# and rewriting one to fold it into a general arm would take that rate out of submission_check.py's
# table with nothing to say it had gone. The general arms overlap them and banned_hits dedupes on
# (line, offset, token). An overlap costs a wasted match and never a doubled finding.
#
# WHAT THE -ise ARM ACTUALLY ENFORCES, and this is worth a sentence because somebody will read it
# as dialect detection and correct it toward Oxford. `-ise` is not reliably British. Oxford usage
# is `-ize` and always was. A tree written in Oxford English trips none of this and a tree
# written in American English trips none of it either. The arm enforces a HOUSE AMERICAN convention
# against one common British convention. It is not a claim about where the writer is from.
#
# PRECISION, MEASURED BEFORE THESE LANDED. The arms were run over five repositories here and over
# 544 files of CPython's standard library and site-packages, which is a large body of American and
# British English nobody here wrote. 530 hits across the five repositories, of which one is a false
# positive: `storyrevised` at theory/Salishan/chapters/chapter_Salishan_refs.tex:463, a
# filename fragment that tex_prose leaves behind because a `\texttt` holding nested `\allowbreak{}`
# braces defeats its stripper. 1,216 hits across the Python tree, of which 34 are identifiers and
# not prose: `vonmises` and `cramervonmises` in scipy, `caretsloperise` in pygments, `sanssecours`,
# `miniser`, and one `suprises` that is a typo for `surprises`. Every other hit in both bodies is a
# British form in running prose. Call that 2.8 percent on somebody else's tree and 0.2 percent on
# this one.
#
# WHAT CAME OUT ON THE SAME EVIDENCE. An `-isable` arm matched `controldisable` and every other
# compound ending in `disable`, and bought three real hits across everything measured. It is gone.
# A general doubled-l arm is not written and cannot be: `controlled`, `installed`, `enrolled` and
# `spelled` are American with two l's. The doubled-l rule stays the named list the standard's own
# sentence gives it. A general `-re` arm is not written for the same reason: `are`, `here`, `more`,
# `figure` and `structure` are the majority of English words ending in those two letters.
#
# The standard's sentence names four shapes. It does not name the `ae` and `oe` digraphs
# (`haemoglobin`, `foetus`, `anaesthetic`). No arm is written for them. Nothing in any tree here
# fired one in the measurement above, and a rule with no measured hit is a rule nobody can tune.

# The ten this file carried before the arms below, in their original order and form.

# WITHDRAWN: THE THIRTEEN UNBOUNDED WORD BANS, AND WHAT TOOK THEM OUT
# ====================================================================
#
# Recorded instead of deleted, because each of these was added for a reason somebody had and a
# later reader who only sees the absence will add it back. The table is the same device
# repo_tools/docs/docs_maint/ai_words.py used for its own six withdrawals.
#
# THE RULE THAT REMOVED THEM. code-documentation section 143: "a word that reads as a tic in one
# construction only is bounded to that construction: paradigm shift is banned where paradigm is
# not." And the escape immediately before it: "A term the field owns stays."
#
# THE TEST THAT FOUND THEM, and it is mechanical. Neither standard bans any of these thirteen. Both
# standards USE eleven of them as ordinary technical English, in the same documents that authorize
# this checker:
#
#   carries      code-documentation:145  "carries this list as regexes"
#   holds        code-comments:208       "holds the list as regexes"
#   reads        code-comments:208       "reads .c and .h comments and docstrings"
#   spends       code-documentation:84   "it spends a reader's trust before it wastes their time"
#   buys         code-documentation:85   "breaks the line the prose is walking and buys nothing"
#   construction code-comments:199       "are essay construction, not comment construction"
#   costs        code-documentation:108  the register a rule applied wrongly costs a paragraph
#   carry        code-documentation:104  "A documented pointer with no token is an unanswered
#                                        question"; :161 "correct when carried by a real name"
#   slot         code-comments:195       "Name a Handle by Its Slots" -- a handle slot is this
#                                        tree's own term of art, named in a section heading
#   earns        code-documentation:114  "each one earned its place by measurement"
#   book         code-documentation:158  "A name already sitting in the tree is not evidence"
#
# So the gate flagged the standard it enforces, 65 times across the two files before this pass,
# every one of them outside a code span and in the standard's own running prose. That is the whole
# of the over-reach class and it needed no enumeration to find.
#
# WHY NONE OF THEM COULD BE BOUNDED THE WAY paradigm shift IS. The construction these read as a tic
# in is an inanimate subject taking a human verb, and no regex separates it from the correct
# technical use. "The header carries the checksum" and "the buffer holds the segment" are the right
# verbs in a network stack, and they are character for character the shape the ban was after.
# What IS bounded, and what these went into, is the is-what-VERB construction near the head of this
# tuple, which both standards name.
#
# WHAT IT COST IN RECALL, derived at the refs named and not carried in from anywhere. Against
# idemIP/src at 29a808c these thirteen produced 1,727 of that run's 2,669 prose findings, 64.7
# percent of the whole report, and none of them is an AI tell: "the header carries the checksum"
# and "the buffer holds the segment" are the right verbs in a TCP/IP stack. Against the two
# SKILL.md files they produced 65 hits, all of them in running prose.
#
# Per word at idemIP/src 29a808c, which is where the weight actually sits: hold 658, carry 518,
# read 337, slot 134, cost 66, spend 6, win 3, pay 2, then one apiece for buy, earn and
# construction. afford, price and book fired nowhere in that tree at all.
#
# Re-derived at 2ec83d2, which is origin/main and the ref that repository sat on an hour later, and
# every one of those numbers is the same. Two refs are named because one is not enough: two sessions
# read 58 British hits and 15 for this repository and the difference between them was a ref and no
# defect at all.
#
# Each entry is the word, what it was after, and the sentence that removed it.

# ====================================================================
# THE THREE STAGES, AND WHAT MEASURED THEM
# ====================================================================
# The list above is one flat table and it was built by noticing. maint/prose/ban_evidence.py
# scored every pattern in it against 1,108,054 words of human research papers under build/papers,
# and against the 403,111 words of prose in this tree. That run split the table into three stages
# that filter at different widths, and the stages behave nothing alike.
#
# ALPHABET. Orthography, and it recovers the locale before it says anything about a writer. The
# papers are Canadian and British convention linguistics. Neighbour fires at 17.3 per hundred
# thousand words in them and analyse at 8.9, behaviour at 4.8, labelled at 2.9, centre at 2.3.
# None of that is machine prose. It is where the author is, and the American spellings this tree
# uses are a house rule and not a defect in anybody's English.
#
# WORD. Vocabulary, and the measurement mostly refutes it. Humans write crucial at 5.5, vital at
# 0.5, journey at 2.2, delve at 0.4, synergy at 2.4, utilize at 2.3 and leverage at 0.5. A ban on
# these removes ordinary academic English. They stay in the table because a house style is allowed
# to be narrower than the field, and they are reported as the weaker class they measured as.
#
# PHRASE. The structural shapes, and every one of them is confirmed. These nine appear 23.3 times
# per hundred thousand words in this tree and exactly zero times in 1.1 million words of human
# writing: is what separates and its family, is what makes, what survives, is the whole of, the
# X-not-Y grammar, that is the whole, and nothing more, what matters is, the one that matters.
# A clause that explains the sentence just written is the signature, and the phrase stage
# catches it.
#
# One caution the numbers earn. Absence from the papers is not proof a phrase is machine written:
# the papers are linguistics and a phrase can be missing because the domain is.
# Re-run ban_evidence.py after changing this table.
#
# MEASURED AGAINST THE ASSISTANT'S OWN PROSE, WHICH SETTLED IT
#
# maint/prose/session_prose.py takes the assistant's messages out of a session transcript. That
# corpus needs no label to be trusted, and it is the only one here whose author is not in question.
# 38,702 gated English words of it, against 759,815 of the papers, per hundred thousand words:
#
#   the whole list            643.4 assistant   387.9 human   112.8 this tree after a day of repair
#   the eight phrase shapes    56.8 assistant     0.0 human    26.4 this tree
#
#   rather                    240.3 assistant    57.6 human      4.2 times the human rate
#   which is why/what/the     131.8 assistant     3.2 human     41 times
#   so a                       46.5 assistant     1.3 human     36 times
#   is the one                 43.9 assistant     2.5 human     18 times
#   is exactly what/why/the    25.8 assistant     0.4 human     65 times
#   and nothing else           12.9 assistant     0.1 human    129 times
#   is what makes              10.3 assistant     0.0 human     absent from 759,815 human words
#   the one that matters        7.8 assistant     0.0 human     absent, and banned here by name
#
# Two things follow. The list was built by noticing and the noticing was accurate: the phrases
# called out by hand are the ones carrying the largest ratios. And every rate above is a floor,
# because those messages were written while the same phrases were under active suppression.
#

# ====================================================================
# THE TWO TIERS, AND WHAT DECIDES WHICH ONE A PATTERN IS IN
# ====================================================================
#
# TIER A is a NAMED-CONSTRUCTION BAN: a construction one of the two standards bans in a sentence,
# quoted below with the file and line it is on. Tree-wide, no opt-in, no per-repo setting, every hit
# a finding. A per-repo switch on this tier would exempt a repository from a standard it is already
# under, which is backwards: the standard is the tree's, not each repository's.
#
# TIER B is FREQUENCY-SCORED VOCABULARY: a word or an idiom, reported with what it costs a human
# writer where that has been measured. Most of it is the machine-prose vocabulary code-documentation
# section 135 through 141 lists by word. The rest is this file's own house style, calibrated on
# anchor_sift's theory books and named as such in the report.
#
# THE TIER IS DECIDED BY THE SENTENCE IN THE STANDARD, NEVER BY THE REGEX. This is the correction
# that matters and it runs both ways:
#
#   `rather` is one token and matches one word. Stage_of calls it a word. Its ban is stated
#   outright at code-documentation:110 and again at code-comments:200. It is TIER A.
#   `\bis what (separates|keeps|...)` is a construction by shape and by authority alike, and the
#   verbs this file added to it beyond the standard's ten are TIER A all the same, because the
#   construction is the thing banned and the verb list is how far it reaches.
#   The X-not-Y patterns span several words and are TIER A. The superlative-adjective group spans
#   several words too and is TIER B, because section 137 lists adjectives.
#
# WHAT THE TIER CHANGES. Nothing about whether a run passes: prose never fails a build in either
# tier, --strict included, and the exit rule at the foot of main() is the whole of that contract.
# It changes what the report says, and it is the line an autofix would have to respect.
#
# A BANNED HINGE IS DISSOLVED, NEVER REPLACED. There is no --fix here and there must never be one
# for TIER A. code-documentation:110 bans `rather`; its obvious repair is the X-not-Y shape, which
# section 146 bans forty lines later in the same document: "The X-not-Y shape sounds decisive and
# carries almost nothing... State the thing that is true and let the contrast go unsaid, unless the
# reader would otherwise land on the wrong one." An automatic repair of the first rule produces the
# second at scale and reports a fix for every one. The two legal treatments are to give the second
# half its own plain sentence, or to drop the weaker half, and section 146's test decides which. A
# machine cannot run that test. Section 143 says the same thing from the other side: bans name
# CONSTRUCTIONS. Detection AND repair operate on constructions and never on words. TIER A is
# report-only, permanently. A token-for-token orthographic swap is the only class an autofix could
# ever own here, and that is the alphabet stage and not this table.

# WHAT MEASURED IT, and this is the single highest-leverage precision rule in the file. The two
# documents that authorize this checker were run against it. code-documentation/SKILL.md reported
# 283 prose findings and 228 hits in it sit inside one of these spans, code-comments/SKILL.md
# another 35. Every one is the standard writing out a token it bans, letting a reader see which
# token is meant. A checker that reports a standard for naming its own bans is reporting the wrong
# thing 263 times, and it was.
#
# THREE MARKERS, and a fourth that was tried and dropped. The backtick span is the bulk of it. The
# italic run is how both files quote a banned shape too long to be a token: code-comments:161 writes
# *That is the difference between a helper naming a step and a helper costing a call* to show what
# an aphoristic clause reads like. The quoted span is the same device with quotes, and its floor is
# one character against PASSAGE's sixteen, because the named forms are short: *"Certainly!"* is ten
# characters and *"load-bearing"* is twelve, and both walked past PASSAGE.
#
# BOLD WAS THE FOURTH AND IT CAME OUT, measured across the two standards, ProtoCore/docs at
# 7bbc628d, idemIP/src at 29a808c and this tree's own docs/ and maint/. Bold exempted one site on
# the standards and five in ProtoCore, and three of those five were real TIER A findings inside a
# heading label: BUGS.md:376 "**What survives from F1/F2:**", :518 "**Why it is deferred rather than
# fixed:**", :1576 "**What it uncovered:**". Bold marks a heading in this tree far more often than
# it marks a citation. The arm was a net loss and is recorded here.
#
# The italic arm refuses a span holding a table cell separator. ProtoCore TUNING.md:154 is a table
# row where two unrelated asterisks in different cells paired across the row and swallowed a real
# `so a`. A citation of a form does not straddle a cell boundary.
#
# WHAT IT COSTS AND WHAT IT BOUGHT, measured after bold came out. It removes 263 findings on the
# two standards, of which 93 are TIER A and 165 TIER B, and every one is the document writing out
# the token it bans. Across ProtoCore/docs, idemIP/src and all six of this tree's own roots it
# removes 5, all TIER B, all correct: `realm` in a fenced `on_http_auth(..., realm, ...)` signature
# and in a `WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="..."` header, which is an HTTP field name. NOT ONE TIER A
# FINDING IS SILENCED ANYWHERE OUTSIDE THE TWO STANDARDS. A banned word that happens to sit in
# backticks anywhere goes quiet, the same trade QUOTED and PASSAGE already make. Bounded to

# ====================================================================
#
# THE FOUR STAGES CALL IN HERE AND NONE OF THEM CARRIES A SKIP OF ITS OWN. A skip written four times
# is four places to forget it and four places for the four copies to drift apart. That is the same
# fault the note above LOCALE records about a rule table duplicated into the table that enforces it.
# There are three call sites and no others: prose_only applies the blanking rules once, and
# em_dashes, markdown_leftovers and banned_tokens therefore inherit them without knowing they exist;
# banned_hits applies the run-level context rules beside QUOTED; main() applies the file-level and
# region-level rules and prints what fired.
#
# NOTHING IS SKIPPED QUIETLY. A silent skip is how everything in this file got here. The canonical
# case came from the closed-repository scan this tool once ran: it covered zero closed repositories
# for the whole of a directory migration and nobody could see it, because "scanned none" and "there
# are none" printed the same nothing. So every exclusion below records what it dropped and why, into
# a Ledger, and main() prints that ledger under the counts. A file this tool declines to read is
# named by the run that declined to read it.
#
# EVERY EXCLUSION STATES ITS REASON IN THE SOURCE AND NOT ONLY ITS RULE. A bare list of paths is the
# kind of thing a later maintainer deletes as overcautious, and they are right to: a rule nobody can
# check is a rule nobody can keep. A list saying why survives. The prior art is idemIP's
# repotools.toml:40-43, followed here instead of reinvented:
#
#     # The two files in this tree that are prose. docs/ is deliberately not a root: everything
#     # under docs/learn is the RFC corpus as the RFC Editor published it, which is not ours to
#     # check and not ours to rewrite.
#
# Three parties reached that rule independently on one day: that config file, the custodian of the
# closed corpus about oracles/, and a prose pass about docs/learn/RFC/. Three arrivals at one rule
# make it a discovered rule and not three preferences, and a discovered rule gets written once.
#
# EVERY RULE HERE IS A FIRST-CLASS RULE AND NOT A SPECIAL CASE. Each one has a name, a reason, a
# measured cost and a test. A special case is a rule with none of those, and it is the thing the
# next person deletes.

# VERBATIM THIRD-PARTY TEXT
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Somebody else's words, reproduced byte for byte. A register finding inside one is a finding
# against its author, and a rewrite inside one corrupts a document this project does not own.
#
# THREE INSTANCES, FOUND SEPARATELY, AND THAT MAKES THIS A CONCEPT:
#
#   idemIP docs/learn/RFC             IETF documents as the RFC Editor published them. RFC 2119
#                                     MUST and SHOULD are normative keywords in that corpus, and
#                                     "Robustness Variable" at src/idemip_config.h:580 is the
#                                     literal name of an RFC 2236 section 8.1 field, quoted in a
#                                     Doxygen brief with its published default.
#   ProtoCore docs/learn/rfc          the same corpus again, lowercased, in a second repository.
#   ProtoCore docs/learn/datasheets   vendor datasheets and the .txt extracted from them.
#   salishan_corpus/oracles           tables transcribed by hand from other people's published
#                                     papers. Their numbers are the published numbers, and a
#                                     transcription that disagrees with its source is worthless.
#
# NAMED AS A CONCEPT AND NOT AS A PATH LIST, and that difference is the whole reason this is written
# as a rule. A path list is a chore somebody has to remember to extend, and the way a chore fails is
# that a fourth corpus arrives and nobody adds it. So there are two answers to the question and
# either one is sufficient: the path sits under one of the defaults below, or the directory declares
# itself by holding a VERBATIM_MARKER file. Nothing in any tree here carries that marker today. It
# exists so the default list is not the only way to answer, and a tree vendoring a corpus this tool
# has never heard of can say so without editing this tool.
#
# WHAT IT COSTS, named here.
# Two files of this project's own prose go quiet with the corpora they index: idemIP
# docs/learn/RFC/README.md and ProtoCore docs/learn/datasheets/README.md. The alternative is an
# allowlist inside each verbatim root, which is a second list to maintain for two files, and the
# ledger names both of them on every run that reads past them.
#
# THE RFC .txt FILES ARE NOT READ TODAY ANYWAY, because .txt is not in CHECKED. That is true and it
# is not the reason this rule exists: the rule has to hold when somebody adds .txt, and a rule whose
# correctness depends on an unrelated tuple staying short is not a rule.

# LEGAL BLOCKS: SPDX AND COPYRIGHT
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# An SPDX identifier and a copyright grant are legal artifacts, and the register of a license grant
# is the license's business. idemIP carries "SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later" on every
# file, and this tree carries a three-way LicenseRef line on every file of its own. Rewriting a word
# inside one edits the artifact.
#
# BLANKED PER BLOCK AND NEVER PER LINE. A GPL grant runs fifteen lines and two of them hold anything
# a regex can find. Blanking the two that matched would leave thirteen lines of legal text standing
# in front of the register scan. Carried from repo_tools/docs/docs_maint/ai_words.py, which this
# pass supersedes.
#
# WHERE A BLOCK ENDS IS THE WHOLE RULE, and getting it wrong in either direction has a cost that was
# measured before this landed. A first attempt split blocks on blank source lines. A `#` alone on a
# line is not blank. The entire 28-line comment header of a maint script read as one block and
# 164 findings went quiet across this tree alone, among them six hits in a file about orthography
# and two tier A hits in another. A block is split instead on MARKER-stripped emptiness, the same
# test runs() already makes, and again wherever the comment form changes or closes.
#
# WITH THAT RULE IT SILENCES NOTHING TODAY. Measured over anchor_sift's six roots, idemIP's whole
# tree, ProtoCore/docs, MMgr and both closed repositories: zero findings. Every legal block in every
# one of those trees is already clean prose, the outcome to want from a rule whose job is
# to protect an artifact. The number is worth re-deriving after any
# change to the block walker, because a walker reaching too far reports the same zero.
#
# THE FIXTURE THIS WAS BUILT AROUND, and it is the sharpest available because both halves sit in one
# file four lines apart. idemIP tools/dev_env/strip_comments.py:2-3 is a real copyright and SPDX
# pair and is not ours to edit. Its :4 and :12 say `licence` in prose ABOUT a license block, which
# is ordinary British convention a person may fix. :4 is the line directly under the header with no
# blank line between them. A block rule reaching one line too far takes it with the header. What
# separates them is the change of comment form from `#` to a docstring. readclean.py:12 and :36 are
# the same shape with a blank line to help, and all four sites survive this rule.

# GENERATED REGIONS
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# REPORTED AND ATTRIBUTED, NEVER SUPPRESSED, and this is the single decision in this section a
# reader is likely to want to reverse. Here is the evidence against reversing it.
#
# ProtoCore's README.md and TOOLS.md carry BEGIN and END GENERATED marker pairs, 20 pairs across 11
# tracked files, and CI regenerates them on push to main. An edit inside one is reverted by the next
# regeneration: the gate reports a fix, the fix disappears, and the finding comes back forever. That
# argues for skipping the region, and it is the wrong move.
#
# THE TREE SAYS WHY. The single genuine structural finding in the whole of ProtoCore/docs is an
# empty table at docs/README.md:2404, and the region from :2399 to :2408 is generated by
# tools/ci_tooling/generate/gen_readme_sections.py. A rule that skips marked regions deletes the one
# finding worth having in that tree and reports it clean. The generator emits a header and a
# separator with no rows under them, unconditionally. Every CI regeneration republishes an empty
# table on a public README. That is a generator defect, a person has to fix it in the generator, and
# the finding is how they find out.
#
# A FINDING INSIDE A MARKED REGION THEREFORE KEEPS ITS PLACE IN THE COUNT and carries the

#
# A British convention is banned unless the subject IS British convention, and this is that clause.
# A passage about it has to be able to write the word it is about. "British English writes colour"
# is a correct sentence, and an alphabet-stage finding on it is the same error as a checker
# reporting a standard for naming its own bans.
#
# THIS EXTENDS THE COMPILED CONTEXT EXEMPTION QUOTED ALREADY IS. That tuple exists for exactly this
# question one instance at a time: the International Conference on Salish and Neighbouring Languages
# spells its own name that way and thirteen extraction headers cite it. Pointing this at the same
# shape is why it is two tuples of compiled patterns and not a new stage.
#
# BOUNDED TO THE ALPHABET TIER AND TO THE RUN, and that keeps it from being a bypass. A
# paragraph mentioning Canada does not get to write `is what makes`. Only a convention finding goes
# quiet, and only inside the run carrying the subject.
#
# THE SUBJECT IS THE CONVENTION AND NOT THE COUNTRY, and the pattern says so. A bare \bbritish\b
# would exempt "British Telecom's optimisation", where the subject is a company and the convention
# is a live finding. Each arm names a word about writing: `english`, `spelling`, `convention`,
# `usage`, `variant`, `orthography`.
#
# MEASURED COST, over anchor_sift's six roots, idemIP's whole tree, ProtoCore/docs, MMgr and both
# closed repositories: zero findings silenced. Nothing in any tree here writes about the convention
# today. The rule is the objective's own clause written down before a document needs it, and
# maint/prose/test_docs_check_exclusions.py re-derives that zero from the trees on disk, and a
# reader checks it instead of trusting this sentence.

#
# THIS IS A REWRITE REFUSAL AND NOT A SCAN EXEMPTION, AND IT WAS WRITTEN AS ONE AND MEASURED OUT.

# in ProtoCore BUGS.md, `initialised`, `labelled` and `behaviours` together at CHANGELOG.md:702,
# `defence` at idemIP dad.c:26, `neighbour` at test_dad.c:961. Not one of the 20 is a field name
# from the standard beside it. The site the rule was written for, "Robustness Variable", matches no
# pattern in LOCALE and produced no finding to exempt in the first place.
#
# A rule that silences twenty correct findings and buys zero is a net loss, and precision over

# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT A REWRITE MAY TOUCH, AND IT IS ALMOST NOTHING
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A BANNED HINGE IS DISSOLVED AND NEVER REPLACED. Detection is mechanical. SUBSTITUTION is where the
# judgement lives, and it is exactly where an automatic rewrite does damage.
#
# THE REASON IS CHECKABLE IN ONE DOCUMENT AND IT IS WHY THIS IS A PERMANENT LIMIT AND NOT A GAP.
# A construction ban targets a rhetorical move and not a word. The nearest synonym preserves the
# move and lands on another banned item. `rather` is banned at code-documentation:110. Its obvious
# repair is the X-not-Y shape, which is banned at :146 of the same document, thirty-six lines later:
# "The X-not-Y shape sounds decisive and carries almost nothing". Anyone repairing the first without
# reading the second produces the second at scale. A pass turning fifty `rather` sites into fifty
# X-not-Y sites reports fifty fixes and leaves the tree measurably worse.
#
# IT HAS HAPPENED. Three times in one day, three different people, all caught before shipping:
# `seamless` proposed as `fast`, where both are named in one praise-adjective ban; "in the header,
# not in the .c" nearly written to replace a `rather than`; and eleven X-not-Y substitutions across
# one ProtoCore file, rejected on review.
#
# THE TWO LEGAL TREATMENTS, from :110 and :146 read together. Give the second half its own plain
# declarative sentence, or drop the weaker half. Dropping is the default, and :146's test is whether
# the reader would otherwise land on the wrong one. THE TEST FOR A BAD REPAIR IS MECHANICAL: if the
# two halves are still adjacent across a comma, the shape survived and only its wording changed.
#
# SO THE ALPHABET TIER IS THE ONLY TIER A REWRITE MAY REACH. initialised to initialized, licence to
# license, behaviour to behavior. Those are token for token and the replacement cannot change the
# shape of the sentence. TIER A AND TIER B STAY REPORT-ONLY permanently. This is not a feature
# nobody has written yet. Read code-documentation:110 and :146 before changing this line.
#
# Pair it with :143, which the note above AUTHORITY already quotes: a word that reads as a tic in
# one construction only is bounded to that construction. Together the two say the whole thing. Bans
# name constructions. Detection AND repair both operate on constructions and never on words, and
# there is no construction a machine can repair.
#
# THE REWRITING HALF IS DELIBERATELY NOT IMPLEMENTED. `--fix` runs this policy over the findings and
# prints what it would and would not touch, and writes nothing. The gate is here first, and on
# purpose: whoever adds the writing half has to come through fix_refusal, and cannot add it without
# meeting the manifest, verbatim, generated and legal refusals that are already tested beside it.

# PRINT THE REVISION MEASURED. One repository read 58 British sites on one branch and 15 on another,
# and the difference looked like a defect in this tool to two separate readers for most of a day. A
# count without its revision is a count about an unspecified tree. And a revision is only authority
# while it is REACHABLE FROM SOMEWHERE DURABLE: a local-only commit is a tree of one, and a fixture
# that lived only inside a linked worktree dies with the session that made it. So the revision is
# printed with its reachability, and "NOT PUSHED" is printed in those words when nothing on a remote
# contains it.
#
# PRINT THE ROOTS SCANNED AND THE ROOTS LOOKED FOR AND NOT FOUND. The closed-repository scan this
# tool once ran taught the reason, and it generalizes: "scanned none" and "there are none" must
# never be the same output, for any root and not only a closed one.
#
# PRINT THE ROOTS IT WAS CONFIGURED WITH, and this is the line that matters most. One repository
# declares roots = ["README.md", "test"] for both its prose gate and its commit hook. Its sixty
# translation units and its CMakeLists.txt are outside that declared scope, and they stay outside it
# after every repair this tool has had. A run reporting "0 findings" over two configured roots reads
# exactly like a clean tree, and that is how a repository carrying dozens of British spellings reads
# as green. The roots go at the top of the report, and a reader meets the scope before the count.
#
# AND SAY WHAT THIS TOOL DOES NOT ANSWER FOR. There are four independent reasons a finding survives
# a gate and each is sufficient alone: the hook is not installed, the declared roots exclude the
# file, the rule cannot match it, and the extension cannot be opened. This file owns the last two.

# orthography, interlinear glosses, IPA and tables of forms. english_gate's own header names
# ban_evidence.py, which generates HUMAN_RATE, as one of three measurements this corpus corrupted,
# and the header above HUMAN_RATE records that correction.
#
# WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND IT WAS WRONG TWICE OVER. The unmeasured branch printed "unused in 1.1M
# human words". 1,108,054 is the UNGATED token count, which the HUMAN_RATE header states is the
# wrong denominator and low by about 40 percent, while the measured branch beside it was already
# dividing by 759,815. Two branches, two denominators, one corpus, in eleven lines of each other.
# And "human words" describes a general English sample, which 154 linguistics papers are not: the
# sentence read as a claim about English and was a claim about these papers.
#
# HOW MUCH OF THE TOOL'S OUTPUT IT WAS. Derived over this tree's own default run immediately before
# this change, at 51f492f with the structural repair applied: 3,981 of 4,296 prose lines carried the

# emitted made a claim about 1.1 million human words. The misdescription was not an edge case in the
# report, it was almost the whole of it.
#

    markdown link syntax without being paths. Both were measured against a Doxygen C repository.

    Measured at ProtoCore f3e96f68, `python maint/prose/docs_check.py <protocore>/docs` reported 251
    breaking findings where 4 were real. 244 were Doxygen references and 3 were C declarators. The

    repository that does use it, the gate would have refused every commit ProtoCore could make. That
    is why this test sits in front of os.path.exists instead of in an exemption list somewhere.

    Doxygen references, 244 of them. [`HTTP_10`](@ref HTTP_10) resolves against documented symbols.
    HTTP_10, HttpVersion, HttpReq::version, send_chunked, WS_FRAME_SIZE, MAX_HEADERS and
    PROTOCORE_ENABLE_KEEPALIVE were each confirmed as live symbols in ProtoCore's source. Every
    one of those findings reported a working cross-reference as a broken link.

    C declarators, 3 of them, at SECURITY.md:903, SSH.md:91 and SSH.md:94. A lambda in a fenced
    example writes `[](const char *user, const char *pass)`, and a parenthesized group following a
    bracketed one is the shape LINK looks for.

    Which signal earns its place. Across anchor_sift, ProtoCore, idemIP, MMgr and embedded_types,
    646 targets are skipped here and not one of them names a path that is on disk. Nothing that
    was a real finding has been silenced. 496 of the 646 are Doxygen commands and the other 150 hold
    a pointer star. Of the three declarator signals only the star fired. The type-keyword head and
    the comma-separated list caught nothing in those five trees and are kept for the parameter list
    that has neither star nor keyword, as in `(uint8_t slot, size_t len)`. The comma rule is the
    loosest of the three and is bounded to items of two words each. `docs/a.md, docs/b.md` stays
