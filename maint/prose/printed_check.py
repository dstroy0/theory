"""The prose standard, applied to the text these tools print instead of the text they carry.

    python maint/prose/printed_check.py [root ...]

WHY THIS EXISTS

`docs_check.py` reads the comments and docstrings of a source file and blanks the code. For a
library, blanking the code is correct. The checkers in `examples/00_blob_viz_tools` are not shaped like libraries
when they run: each one prints several paragraphs of argument about what it measured, and a person
reads those paragraphs the way they read a page. None of that text sits in a comment, so none of it
was gated.

The gap was found by reading output instead of by any check, and it had already let two findings
through into tools written under the standard.

docs-check: quoting
`quotient_coherence` printed 'which is the average of those two' and `reading_rank` printed
'which is why 64 distinct signatures out of 64 rounds is not evidence'.
docs-check: end quoting

Both phrases sit on the banned table, both sat in text a reader sees, and both survived a clean run
of `docs_check`.

WHAT IT READS

The string literals handed to `say`, `print` and `sys.stdout.write`, taken from the parse tree so
that a string built across several lines is read once and a string in a comment is not read twice.
The banned table comes from `docs_check` itself through the symlink in this directory, so there is
one table and this file does not hold a copy of it to drift.

Exit status follows `docs_check`: zero clean, one for findings, two for the sentinel that says no
file was read. Never a count. `docs_check` records why, and the reasons apply here unchanged: a count
wraps at 256, so 256 findings would exit clean, and returning 2 for a real pair of findings is
indistinguishable from the run that read nothing.
