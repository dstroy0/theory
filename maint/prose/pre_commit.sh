# The prose gate for theory_bucket, run by .git/hooks/pre-commit.
#
# Doug, 2026-09-25: "theory/ workbooks/ and thought_experiments/ from our repo have a zero tolerance
# gate, other repo files are ignored. only our concerns are flagged".
#
# prose_ratchet.tsv holds its header and no file, so every staged file under the three roots has a
# ceiling of 0 prose findings. A breaking finding anywhere under the roots stops the commit.
# Exit codes are docs_check's: 1 breaking, 2 read nothing, 3 a staged file carries prose, 4 no
# ratchet. printed_check reads the .py under the roots; none are there today, and its 2 says so.
