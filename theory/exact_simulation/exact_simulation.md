# Exact Simulation

Carry the amplitude, not a rounding of it.

A quantum state is a vector of complex amplitudes. A mainstream simulator stores each one as a
floating-point pair. There `1/sqrt2` becomes `0.70710678...`, the norm drifts off one, and a circuit
run forward then inverted lands *near* the start instead of *on* it. This engine keeps every
amplitude as an exact element of a number field. Nothing is rounded: the norm is exactly one, two
equal states are equal to the bit, and an inverse circuit returns to the start state exactly.

Everything below is output the two engines actually produced, not a claim written ahead of them.

## The field

The standard gate set `{X, Y, Z, S, H, CNOT, CZ, controlled-T}` needs only a short list of numbers:
`0, 1, -1, i, -i, 1/sqrt2, (1+i)/sqrt2`. All of them live in

    Q(sqrt2)[i] = { (a + b*sqrt2) + i*(c + d*sqrt2) : a, b, c, d in Q }

an element is four exact rationals. The field is closed under `+ - * /`, and every amplitude a
circuit over that gate set can reach stays inside it. `H`'s `1/sqrt2 = (1/2)*sqrt2` and the
controlled phase's `(1+i)/sqrt2` are held exactly and never decay. The reference implementation
carries the quadruple as four `fractions.Fraction` values and uses no numeric library.

## Compact form (matrix product state)

The state is held as one small tensor per qubit, joined by bonds. The bond across a cut is the exact
Schmidt rank there. After every two-qubit gate the bond is trimmed by a rank-revealing factorization
`M = C*F` computed by exact Gaussian elimination over the field. No singular value is ever formed.
Cost scales with the entanglement actually present, not with the qubit count.

Output of `mps_qubits.py`:

| state | qubits | bond dims | field elements | vs dense |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bell `(|00>+|11>)/sqrt2` | 2 | `[2]` | 8 | `2^2 = 4` |
| GHZ-6 | 6 | `[2,2,2,2,2]` | 40 | `2^6 = 64` |
| GHZ-4 + controlled-T | 4 | `[2,2,2]` | 24 | `2^4 = 16` |
| GHZ-100 | 100 | `[max 2]` | **792** | `2^100 ~ 10^30` |
| scrambler (10q, depth 6) | 10 | `[2,3,6,8,8,8,6,3,2]` | 552 | `2^10 = 1024` |

- `<psi|psi> = EXACTLY 1` for every one of them.
- Reversibility: a 5-qubit circuit then its exact inverse returns to `|00000>` to the bit.
- Cross-checks against the dense engine on 6 qubits, all 64 amplitudes: **AGREE** (GHZ chain,
  GHZ + controlled-T, scrambler depth 6).

A hundred entangled qubits is real 100-partite entanglement in 792 numbers, not `2^100` amplitudes.
The scrambler's rising-then-falling bond profile is the entanglement light-cone measured exactly.

## Symbolic form (a parameter carried, not pinned)

The field is extended to `Q(sqrt2)[i](w)`, where `w = e^{i*phi(Delta)}` is a distance-dependent phase
carried as a *formal* unit on the circle: `conj(w) = 1/w`, and `w * conj(w) = 1` exactly. Amplitudes
become exact rational functions of `w`, reduced by polynomial GCD. The same rank-revealing
factorization runs unchanged. A bond trims only under linear dependence that holds for *every*
`Delta`.

An observable is read by a **boundary lens**: instead of expanding the state to `2^n` numbers, the
operator is inserted locally and the physical legs are contracted from the edges inward, returning
`<psi|O|psi>` as one exact field element.

Output of `symbolic_qubits.py`, on `(|00> + w|11>)/sqrt2`:

    <X0 X1> = (w + 1/w)/2 = cos(k/Delta^3)
    <Z0 Z1> = 1
    <X0>    = 0
    <psi|psi> = 1        (EXACTLY 1 -- the unitary phase cancels)

and on `(|000> + w|111>)/sqrt2`: `<X0 X1 X2> = cos(k/Delta^3)`, bond dims `[2,2]`. A product state
`|+++>` with a single-qubit phase stays rank one: bond dims `[1,1]`.

The lens reads the separation back as an exact function of it; the `Delta` never becomes a number.

## Host-against-host cross-check

Specializing `w = e^{i*pi/4}` makes `CPHASE(e^{i*pi/4})` the controlled-T gate. The symbolic
engine and the numeric engine must agree at that point:

    symbolic <X0X1> at w = e^{i pi/4} : (1/2)*sqrt2
    numeric  <X0X1> (controlled-T)    : (1/2)*sqrt2
    cos(pi/4) = 1/sqrt2               : AGREE
    norm at w = e^{i pi/4}            : 1  (EXACTLY 1)

Two independent representations landing on the same exact rational is the agreement a verified
computation is built on.

## Scope

Exact arithmetic, an exact state, and an exact reading are general-purpose: they serve chemistry,
physics, and the verification of any circuit, and they reveal nothing about what a given circuit
computes. The claim is exactness as a substrate, and the three forms a state takes on it: dense,
compact, symbolic.
