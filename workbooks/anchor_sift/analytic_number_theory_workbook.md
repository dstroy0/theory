# Analytic number theory workbook

**Purpose:** Record what the engine's exact arithmetic shows when it is pointed at analytic number
theory, one poke at a time, claiming nothing. **Scope:** `examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_values.py`,
`evidence/proofs/posits/proof_set_theory.py`, and this file.

Kept by the precision measurement specialist. This is a workbook, not a result. It follows the rail the
millennium book set down (`theory/theory/millennium/chapters/chapter_what_this_is.tex`), because that
book already refused the exact temptation this one has to refuse:

- Claim nothing. No open problem is attacked here. A method that led a book would already claim to
  reach something; nothing of that kind is claimed or supported.
- Cite nothing unread. A fact that arrived by report says so in the sentence carrying it.
- Gaps go in the sentence making the claim, not in a footnote.
- Withdrawn entries stay on the page with whatever killed them.
- Draw the bar, never derive it. A threshold reasoned out of a distribution inherits every variance
  source it forgot.

What this workbook has that a pen-and-paper one lacks is exact arithmetic: every number below is
carried with no rounding, and checked by a second route. That buys verification to any number of
places. It does not buy a proof, and the difference is the reason for the rail above.

## Entry 1, 2026-09-16: zeta at the even integers

`examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_values.py`, run and exit 0. It computes the Riemann zeta function
at the even integers, `zeta(2k) = c_k * pi^(2k)`, with `c_k` an exact rational from the Bernoulli
numbers, and checks the values a second way that never touches `pi`.

- The values: `zeta(2) = 1.644934...`, `zeta(4) = 1.082323...`, up to `zeta(16)`, with coefficients
  `1/6, 1/90, 1/945, 1/9450, 1/93555, 691/638512875, 2/18243225, 3617/325641566250`. `pi` is computed
  to 80 places by Machin's formula and by Euler's, and they agree.
- The second route: Euler's convolution identity, `sum_{j=1}^{k-1} zeta(2j) zeta(2k-2j) =
(k + 1/2) zeta(2k)`. Every term carries `pi^(2k)`. The factor cancels and the identity is an exact
  rational statement about the `c_k`, derived a different way than the Bernoulli formula. It holds on
  the computed coefficients. A wrong coefficient, `zeta(4) = pi^4/80` in place of `/90`, breaks it, the
  drawn null.
- Prior art: the closed form for `zeta(2k)` is Euler's, eighteenth century, and standard. This file
  reproduces the values in exact integers and verifies them by the convolution identity; it does not
  originate them.

**What this is and is not.** These are the VALUES of zeta at the even integers. The Riemann hypothesis
is a statement about the ZEROS of `zeta(s)` in the critical strip, and no zero is computed or touched
here. Nothing in this entry bears on it.

## Entry 2, 2026-09-16: the set the values live in

`evidence/proofs/posits/proof_set_theory.py`, run and exit 0. It proves, by construction, four standard
facts and connects them to the measurement floor.

- The generation operator is a Moore closure: extensive, monotone, idempotent, with closed sets closed
  under intersection. One round of derivation is extensive and monotone but not idempotent, the null;
  a closure is the fixed point.
- The exactly-nameable quantities are countable: a finite description over a finite alphabet lands at a
  finite index, and the enumeration is shown injective and a contiguous prefix of the naturals on a
  sample.
- The reals are not countable: Cantor's diagonal builds, from any finite table, a real differing from
  every row.
- A countable set has measure zero: it is covered by intervals of total length below any `epsilon`,
  while the unit interval is not.
- Prior art: Cantor 1891 for the diagonal, Turing 1936 for the computable reals being a countable
  subset, and the standard result that the computable reals have measure zero. Reported from a web
  search, not from the primary papers, which are unread here; the constructions are reproduced and
  verified in the file. The file stands on the reproduction, not the citation.

**The connection, stated carefully.** A zeta value at an even integer is `c_k * pi^(2k)`, an exactly
nameable number, one point in the countable set. A measured quantity is a real the engine can only
bracket to its deposit, and almost every real has no finite description. It lies in the uncountable
complement. The measurement floor of the precision document is that boundary. This is an observation
about where exact and measured quantities sit, and it makes no claim about any open problem.

## Entry 3, 2026-09-16: the symmetry of the zeros, and a dream kept in its column

`examples/0_experimental/zeta_zero_symmetry.py`, run and exit 0. What is proven and what is dreamed are
kept in separate columns here, by design.

PROVEN, exactly. The zero set is invariant under a Klein four-group: the functional equation's
involution `s -> 1 - s`, conjugation `s -> conj(s)`, and their composition `s -> 1 - conj(s)`, whose
fixed set is the critical line `Re(s) = 1/2`. On Gaussian rationals the file verifies the three
maps are involutions, the group closes, the fixed set is the critical line, and an orbit on the line
collapses from four points to a conjugate pair. This is the same shape as the transform's wave inversion
one level down: an involution and the fixed set it turns around, `m -> -m` fixing `0` and `n/2`, and
`s -> 1 - conj(s)` fixing the critical line. The two symmetries are theorems, the functional equation
and the real coefficients; the file verifies only the group they generate, which needs no zero.

DREAMED, and left as a dream. The zeros carry a fine structure that looks universal: rescaled by the
local mean spacing, their pair correlation matches the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble of random Hermitian
matrices. Montgomery conjectured it in 1973, Dyson recognized the GUE form on sight, and Odlyzko gave it
strong numerical support at heights near `10^20`. The DENSITY is a theorem, the Riemann-von Mangoldt
count `N(T) ~ (T / 2pi) log(T / 2pi) - T / 2pi`. That the distribution is exactly that one universal
form, and that every zero is a fixed point of `s -> 1 - conj(s)`, the Riemann hypothesis itself, is a
conjecture with strong numerical support and no proof. It is fun to dream that a single fingerprint
forces it. The dream is not a proof, and it stays in this column labeled a dream. Proof is proof. Prior
art: Montgomery 1973, Dyson, Odlyzko; reported from a web search, papers unread.

## The problem, stated fully

Written here so it sits in one place a later entry can find, and not adopted as a target. The Riemann zeta function is
`zeta(s) = sum_{n>=1} n^{-s}` for `Re(s) > 1`, continued analytically to the whole complex plane apart
from a simple pole at `s = 1`. Its trivial zeros are the negative even integers. Its non-trivial zeros
lie in the critical strip `0 < Re(s) < 1`. The Riemann hypothesis is that every non-trivial zero has
real part exactly `1/2`, the critical line. This workbook writes the statement down and does nothing
with it.

## The bounding function for zeta

Placing zeta in the boundary table of the precision document, section 10:

- The values at the even integers are DEFINED: `zeta(2k) = c_k pi^{2k}`, an exact rational times an
  exact transcendental. Their boundary is a FORMAT boundary, the precision scale, raisable without
  limit; there is no measurement floor and no completeness floor on a value.
- The values at the odd integers, Apery's `zeta(3)` and up, are also defined, computed by a convergent
  series to any precision, the same format boundary. No closed form in `pi` is known for them, a fact
  about the FORM and not a boundary on the precision.
- The ZEROS carry a COMPLETENESS boundary. A computation names finitely many, to a stated precision, at
  a horizon: Titchmarsh named 1041, Turing extended the method, Odlyzko reached 20 billion near the
  `10^23`-rd, Gourdon the first `10^13`. None of those is all of them, and no precision closes the gap;
  only more computation moves the horizon, and the horizon never reaches a statement about every zero.
  That is the completeness boundary of section 6, on its most famous instance.

Zeta sits in two regimes at once, like particle physics: its values are defined and unbounded in
precision, and its zeros carry the completeness boundary the hypothesis lives behind.

## Constructors, and what inherits their proof

The exact quantities are built by a fixed set of constructors: the exact integer and rational
operations, the identity hyperedges, and the convergent exact series for the transcendentals, `pi` by
Machin and by Euler, a logarithm by artanh, a root by the integer square root.
`evidence/proofs/posits/proof_precision_theorems.py` proves those constructors sound: scale invariance,
the no-alias convolution, CRT bijectivity, the Fermat inverse, exact accumulation.
`proof_set_theory.py` proves the generation operator over them is a Moore closure.

A quantity built only from proven constructors inherits their proof. `zeta(2k) = c_k pi^{2k}` is a
rational from the Bernoulli recurrence times a power of `pi` from a proven series, combined by proven
exact multiplication. Its exactness is not a new thing to prove; it is the constructors' exactness
carried through. The convolution identity is then a check that the carried value is the intended one, a
second route in the sense Blum, Luby and Rubinfeld gave result checking: a simpler independent
computation that catches a faulty one without trusting it. What is never inherited is a statement about
the zeros, because no constructor produces one.

## Prior art, two threads

- Result checking by agreement. That a value is trusted only when a second, independent route confirms
  it is program result checking and self-testing/correcting: Blum and Kannan; Blum, Luby and Rubinfeld,
  "Self-Testing/Correcting with Applications to Numerical Problems", JCSS 1993. The engine's discipline,
  two routes or it does not ship, is that idea. Reported from a web search, the papers unread here, and
  the file stands on the reproduction.
- The computational path on zeta. Others walked it without exact arithmetic. Riemann's unpublished
  formula, recovered by Siegel in 1932; Titchmarsh's 1930s machine computation of 1041 zeros; Turing in
  1953, whose method reads the real-valued function on the critical line (Odlyzko, "Alan Turing and the
  Riemann Zeta Function"); the Odlyzko-Schonhage algorithm and Odlyzko's 20 billion zeros near the
  `10^23`-rd; Gourdon's `10^13`. They used floating point, high-precision floating point and interval
  arithmetic, and they computed the ZEROS this workbook has not touched. Exact arithmetic adds no
  rounding and a second route on the VALUES; it does not yet reach where their work is. Reported from a
  web search, papers unread.

## The precision-as-obstacle tradition, and where exact arithmetic sits

A whole line of work reached for verified arithmetic because floating point could not carry a proof.
The statement is standard: floating point is subject to rounding and is not suitable for a numerically
verified proof. Verified computing uses interval arithmetic, carrying each quantity as an interval
guaranteed to contain the true value, with directed rounding at each step. On zeta, David Platt isolated
every non-trivial zero with imaginary part below about `3 * 10^10` to an absolute precision of `2^-102`,
and verified the list complete with a rigorous version of Turing's method, at a cost in multi-precision
certified numerics far above hardware floating point. That is an independent verification of the
hypothesis up to that height, and it was possible only by leaving floating point behind.

Where exact arithmetic sits in that tradition is worth stating exactly, because it is easy to overstate.
Exact arithmetic is the limit of the interval: a zero-width interval, the value carried with no rounding
at all, when the value is exactly nameable. The zeta VALUES at the integers are exactly nameable. A non-trivial ZERO is not: it is a transcendental point in
the critical strip, one of the uncountable reals with no finite description from entry 2. No
arithmetic, exact included, names it. The most any computation does with a zero is bracket it, and
Platt's `2^-102` interval is that bracket done rigorously. Exact arithmetic does not supersede that
work; it sharpens the value side to zero width and leaves the zero side to the same verified enclosure
the field already uses. Reported from a web search, the papers unread here.

This is the honest reason the earlier entries touch the values and not the zeros: the values are in the
countable set exact arithmetic was built for, and the zeros are not.

## Open, not done

- Computing `zeta(s)` in the critical strip, and a first non-trivial zero to high precision, needs
  complex arithmetic and an accelerated method (Riemann-Siegel, or Euler-Maclaurin). That is a larger
  poke than this entry, and it is not attempted here. When it is, it will be a numerical observation at
  a stated precision, never a statement about all zeros.
- Whether every non-trivial zero is an exactly nameable number is a separate question from where it
  sits, and it is not addressed here.

## Withdrawn

Nothing withdrawn yet. The rail keeps this heading, and a later reader knows a pulled claim would
appear here with what killed it, instead of vanishing.
