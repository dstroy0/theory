# Each build reports its latexmk exit status, its page count, and three counts read from its log: missing
# characters, overfull boxes and undefined references. A missing character is a glyph the page silently
# dropped, which on a book setting Salishan orthography is a wrong page with no error.

# IT FAILS CLOSED. Exit 1 when either build fails or the working tree build has more missing characters,
# overfull boxes or undefined references than the base. Exit 2 on a usage error. Exit 0 otherwise.
